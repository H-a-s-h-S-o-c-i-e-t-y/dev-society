# Dev Society – Issue Lifecycle

Version: 1.0  
Status: Foundational Operational Specification  
Authority: Dev Society Constitution  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the formal lifecycle of an Issue within the Dev Society governance and development system.

An Issue is the only legitimate trigger of autonomous development activity.

No code may be written, modified, reviewed, or merged without an Issue passing through the states defined here.

---

## 2. Core Principle

All development is state-driven.

Every Issue must exist in exactly one state at any given time.

State transitions must be:

- Explicit
- Logged
- Auditable
- Deterministic

No hidden transitions are permitted.

---

## 3. Lifecycle States

An Issue progresses through the following states:

- Proposed
↓
- Validated
↓
- Risk Classified
↓
- Approved for Execution
↓
- In Implementation
↓
- Under Review
↓
- Consensus Achieved
↓
- Merged
↓
- Closed


Each state has strict entry and exit conditions.

---

## 4. State Definitions

---

### 4.1 Proposed

Definition:
The Issue has been formally created but not yet verified.

Entry Conditions:
- Issue contains required fields:
  - Unique identifier
  - Category
  - Objective
  - Scope
  - Justification

Exit Conditions:
- Schema validation passed
- Category confirmed

Responsible Actor:
- Human Maintainer
- Governance Agent (proposal)
- Metrics Agent (observational)

No development activity is permitted in this state.

---

### 4.2 Validated

Definition:
The Issue schema and category have been verified as correct.

Entry Conditions:
- Structural validation passed
- Protected domain scan completed

Exit Conditions:
- Risk classification completed

Responsible Actor:
- Validation Agent

---

### 4.3 Risk Classified

Definition:
The Issue has been assigned a risk level.

Risk Levels:
- Low
- Medium
- High

Entry Conditions:
- Scope analyzed
- Affected modules identified

Exit Conditions:
- If Low/Medium → automatic progression
- If High → human escalation required

Responsible Actor:
- Risk Classification Agent

---

### 4.4 Approved for Execution

Definition:
The Issue is authorized to enter implementation.

Entry Conditions:
- Risk evaluation completed
- Required approvals obtained
- Protected domains cleared

Exit Conditions:
- Implementation started

Responsible Actor:
- Governance Agent
- Human Maintainer (for high-risk approval)

---

### 4.5 In Implementation

Definition:
An implementation branch is being generated.

Entry Conditions:
- Approved for Execution

Actions:
- Code generation
- Test generation
- Documentation updates

Exit Conditions:
- Pull Request created

Responsible Actor:
- Implementation Agent

---

### 4.6 Under Review

Definition:
Implementation is being reviewed by independent agents.

Entry Conditions:
- Pull Request exists
- Implementation logs available

Actions:
- Code analysis
- Test validation
- Invariant verification
- Architectural consistency check

Exit Conditions:
- Review decisions recorded

Responsible Actors:
- Reviewer Agent A
- Reviewer Agent B (independent configuration)

---

### 4.7 Consensus Achieved

Definition:
Reviewers agree on acceptance.

Entry Conditions:
- At least two independent approvals
- No constitutional violation detected

Exit Conditions:
- Merge authorization granted

If disagreement:
- Escalation required

---

### 4.8 Merged

Definition:
Code has been merged into protected branch.

Entry Conditions:
- Consensus achieved
- Merge authorization confirmed

Actions:
- Commit logged
- Version updated
- Audit record created

Exit Conditions:
- Post-merge validation passed

---

### 4.9 Closed

Definition:
The Issue is fully resolved.

Entry Conditions:
- Merge completed
- All logs stored
- No pending escalation

This state is terminal.

---

## 5. Escalation Rules

Escalation is mandatory when:

- Risk level = High
- Reviewers disagree
- Constitutional conflict detected
- Protected domain modification requested
- Invariant violation suspected

Escalated Issues require Human Constitutional Maintainer intervention.

---

## 6. State Transition Constraints

Allowed transitions:

- Proposed → Validated
- Validated → Risk Classified
- Risk Classified → Approved for Execution
- Approved for Execution → In Implementation
- In Implementation → Under Review
- Under Review → Consensus Achieved
- Consensus Achieved → Merged
- Merged → Closed

Backward transitions are prohibited except via explicit Escalation Reset.

---

## 7. Logging Requirements

Each transition must log:

- Timestamp
- Responsible agent
- Model version
- Prompt hash (if applicable)
- Decision rationale
- Risk level (if applicable)

Logs must be immutable and auditable.

---

## 8. Determinism Requirement

Given:

- Same Issue definition
- Same model versions
- Same configuration

The state progression must be reproducible.

Non-deterministic drift must trigger monitoring alerts.

---

## 9. Parallel Execution

Multiple Issues may progress independently.

However:

- Only one Issue may modify a protected domain at a time.
- Conflict detection must be enforced.

---

## 10. Governance Invariant

No Issue may skip states.

No Issue may self-approve.

No agent may both implement and provide final approval.

Separation of responsibilities is mandatory.

---

## 11. Minimal Operational Loop

The minimal autonomous cycle is:

Issue → Validate → Classify → Implement → Review → Consensus → Merge

This loop defines the operational heartbeat of Dev Society.

---

## 12. Future Extensions

Potential extensions:

- Automated rollback state
- Simulation-before-merge state
- Economic impact simulation state
- Multi-agent deliberation layer

These are not active in Version 1.0.
