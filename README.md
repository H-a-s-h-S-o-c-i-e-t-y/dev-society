# Dev Society

> An autonomous multi-agent governance system for developing and evolving the Hash Society protocol.

---

## Overview

Dev Society is an AI-orchestrated multi-agent system designed to develop, review, test, and maintain the Hash Society protocol with minimal human intervention.

It is not a coding assistant.

It is a structured artificial society composed of specialized agents operating under explicit governance rules, architectural constraints, and formal invariants.

The human maintainer acts as the constitutional authority, not as the primary developer.

## Purpose

The Dev Society exists to:

- Develop and evolve the Hash Society protocol
- Preserve ontological consistency
- Reduce systemic bias through multi-model review
- Enforce architectural invariants
- Maintain reproducibility and scientific rigor
- Experiment with autonomous open-source governance

This repository contains the orchestration logic and governance framework for that artificial society.
